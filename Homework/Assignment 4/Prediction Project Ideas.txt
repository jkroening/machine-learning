Prediction Project Ideas

compute album similarity to recommend similar albums

once you've determined coefficients for each user as they apply to all the feature metadata, see if you can pca those down into 3 coefficients and use those as a unique "RGB" value for that user.

find someway to use the coefficients to describe the user using a "Top 5" of their music personality.
Pare down all the features into a total of 34 or some logical number like Strengths, then bin the features accordingly for purposes of describing a Top 5 per user.

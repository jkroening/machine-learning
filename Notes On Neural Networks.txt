vector of range(i) x features

for i in range(number of Thetas):
    z_i = x_i.dot(Theta_i)
    a_i = sigmoid(z_i)

def sigmoid(x):
    * sigmoid function here *


forward propogation:
    predicts ys, and defines cost for those predictions

back propogation:
    backtracks through each level using the defined cost to improve each level of modeling

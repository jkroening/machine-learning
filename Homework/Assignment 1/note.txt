## Note:
a linear model is probably not the most realistic fit for this data because
at some point, if the car is heavy enough you're going to get an MPG of 0.
so long as we're still talking about cars here, and not boulders, every car
has an MPG, it will never be 0.  And conversely, a really light car will likely
achieve better MPG than just slightly worse than the y-intercept, which a
linear model would suggest.  It's probable that the better fit is some sort of
inverse function where it's forever in the first quadrant, never touching non-
positive values.
